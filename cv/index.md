**Fastable/DE-CIX** _(Late 2021 - Mid 2022)_ Madrid - Spain (100% Remote)
- Developed a custom API to communicate with specific network routing systems like NSP
but with the IX-API definition restrictions plus specific requirements defined by the client (DE-CIX) to build a "CloudRouter".

**Twilio** _(Late 2018 - Late 2021)_ Madrid - Spain (100% Remote)
- Designed and implemented an ad hoc solution for globalization, localization, and translation within a heavily customized version of Wagtail, an open-source CMS architecture.
- Coded a very intense data migration of hundreds of unorganized, static code samples used in the documentation of Twilio libraries exposed in its website into dynamic code samples.
- Became the go-to person for new system design questions, new features, and almost every question regarding the back end of the Twilio site.


**Imagination** _(early 2015 - mid 2017)_ London - United Kingdom
- Senior Backend Developer as part of the Tech Studio team.
- We developed Imagination's onsite show Platform (XPKit) from scratch.
- Made critical decisions in the very fast-paced, high-stakes marketing environment. Our motto was, "The show must go on, we will deliver."
- Became the technical studio senior engineer and go-to person for all questions regarding the black box we created for shows to run smoothly.
- _(Mid 2017 - Late 2018)_  I continued to work for Imagination with the same responsibilities, only 100% remotely.

- Backend Developer and Head of the Development team.
- We developed tools for VoIP service clients, security applications in telecommunications and media.

**Efors** _(2011 - 2012)_ Berlin - Germany
- Developed and implemented front-end pages from scratch using HTML5, CSS, and jQuery
